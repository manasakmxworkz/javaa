1)Polymorphism :When we have class is related to each other and an object behave differently

There are 2 types of polymorphism
i)Compile time polymorphism
->When we call to a method at a compile time is called compile time polymorphism
->Compile time polymorphism is nothing but Method overloading
->Method Overloading is a same method name in a same class

ii)Run time polymorphism
->When we call to a method at a run time is called Run time polymorphism
->Runtime polymorphism is nothing but Method overriding

3)Inheritance: The process of acquiring the property from one class(parent/super/base) to another class(child/sub/derived) is called Inheritance
->To acquire the properties we are using extends keyword
->Inheriting the property->Parent class
->Inherited the property->Child class

2)Constructor Chaining: Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor
